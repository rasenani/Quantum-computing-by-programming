# Fundamentals-of-quantum-gates
Fundamentals-of-quantum-gates deals with the basic concepts and implementations of basic single and multi-qubit gates. The notebooks deal with some quirky behaviour of quantum gates, shows how a quantum gate is equivalent to a unitary transformation and helps cultivate an intuition for statevector manipulation using quantum gates in a quantum circuit.
